# n8n-automation-workflow

This repository contains a small automation project I built using [n8n].  
It was originally created during a free trial of n8n, and the workflow file (JSON) is no longer accessible.  
To demonstrate the project, I have included a screen recording of the workflow in action.

## Workflow Summary
- Fetches data from **ZenQuotes API**.
- Updates entries in **Google Sheets** automatically.
- Sends **email notifications** using Gmail API.
- Demonstrates how low-code automation tools can reduce manual effort.

## Files
- `demo.mp4` â†’ Screen recording of the workflow running.

## Tech Used
- n8n (workflow automation)
- Google Sheets API
- Gmail API
- ZenQuotes API
